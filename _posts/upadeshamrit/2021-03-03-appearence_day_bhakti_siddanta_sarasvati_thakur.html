<h2>Jai Prabhupad Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Sarasvati Thakur Appearence day March 03, 2021</h2>h2>

<p>Vaishnav Thakur, Please bless all of us so that we can indulge in service the way you wanted. </p>

<p>Who is vaishnav?  How we should respect a vaishnav?</p>

<p>They are not from this material world. They came here to deliver fallen souls. But we are again captivated by our minds, not able to understand who is vaishnav. Actually, We claim ourselves as Vaishnav. Vasihnav is not vastu (part) of this material world. They come here to please Lord Guaranga by taking part in Leela.</p>

<p>Prabhupada Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Sarasvati Thakur is Our North Star. In this darkness, we are not able to see the path to devotion. He is the only Hope. We must read and follow His instructions provided to us by Our Great Gaudiya Vaishnav Archaryas.</p>

<p>Jai Prabhupad Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Sarasvati Thakur !!</p>
