<p>It is devotee's business to remain in touch with the absolute Truth twenty-four hours a day. If we associate with a living source, a Vaishnava, and hear <l>hari-katha from him, we will certainly develop faith in the Supreme Lord and awaken our propensity to serve Him. If we wish to become devotees, we must associate with Vaishnavas. Associating with and fully surrendering to Vaishnavas removes our impediments. The Vaishnava's duty is to make his companions and dependents fearless, free from the anxiety, happy, and to deliver all conditioned souls from Maya's hands. It is Vaishnav's business to induce all materialistic living entities to become inclined toward the Supreme Lord. This is real compassion. Our spiritual success is guaranteed if we are honest in our dealings with Vaishnavas, hear attentively from them, and lead our lives according to their instructions. Only then can we be said to be taking advantage of their association. </p>
